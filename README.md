## Recipe Central
- Proposal by Emily Nesson
## What and Why?
I would like to build a software system that allows for people to write and share recipes. Users would be able to create posts with recipes, react to others, make comments, and possibly more. The software would group recipes based on key words/ titles- for example, if the recipe is vegan, there will be a subsection of recipes organized into a "Vegan" section, and the software will put other recipes of the same category into that section. If the recipe does not belong to a previously created section, the software will create a new section for the recipe. The recipes can also be tagged as easy, medium, or difficult on a level of how complicated it is to make the recipe. This can solve a problem of having trouble of finding an interactive recipe sharing platform, and is important in that recipes will be conveniently grouped and so easily findable and sharable for users.

## For Whom?
This software will be for anyone who wants be able to use an interactive recipe platform, whether they are trying to learn how to make new things or just continue to learn more recipes to share with others. Specifically, this would be a useful platform potentially for people like me, in their 20s who are not the most experienced with cooking, who would like to find easy recipes to start learning how to make new things, and then to try more difficult recipes as they get the hang of it.

## How?
The system will have a main feed of recipes, based on those most recently added to the system. There will be a side-bar with various recipe categories with the grouped recipe types (ex. Vegan), as well as a search bar where users can look for specific recipes or groups of recipes. They can also filter their search/recipe feed by selecting that the ones shown be a certain level of difficulty (easy, medium, difficult). There will be a section in which the user can publish their own recipe as well. On each recipe on their feed or that they search, the user will be able to interact with the post by liking it and by adding a comment under the recipe post giving feedback or asking questions. There will also be a share feature that allows for the user to easily send the recipe to friends.

## Scope
I believe that this proposal is not too easy or too ambitious as a project as per this course's parameters because, personally, it would take a lot to learn how to implement this system, and I believe that if the group is able to finish the system that I have outlined, that it is flexible in that it would be easy to continue to implement new features that I have not outlined in this proposal if we were to find ourselves with extra time. If the project is more difficult that we had first thought, I believe that the project would still be viable without certain features. Thus, this proposal  offers enough flexibility and difficulty that it is an appropriate undertaking for this semester.

## Collaboration
None
